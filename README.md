# FaceBlur
Use this to for example blur faces.

For max OPSEC please use on an airgapped device.

For less OPSEC but still enough for most usecases, please open it and then turn off internet when it has loaded in fully.

This is not because I have knowingly put any malware in it, but because I have not checked the obfuscated code from libraries in it and because it could technically get loaded with malware on it's way to be downloaded by you or me.
